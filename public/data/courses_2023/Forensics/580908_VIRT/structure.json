Since even identical twins do not have the same fingerprints, it couldn’t be a case of simple genetics. Scientists, using a combination of mouse experiments and computer modelling, have recently cracked code<sup class='bodySupscript'>1</sup>. Fingerprints develop in utero and start growing simultaneously in three directions - from the top, bottom and center. When these patterns meet, they push into each other, affecting the growth of the other sections. This creates the patterns that make up fingerprints. The scientists in this study determined that this formation is controlled by three genes which each control a different aspect of fingerprint development. They were able to manipulate the expression of these genes in mice and see changes in patterns on toe pads (which are like human fingertips). Very small changes in the timing and levels of expression of these genes affected how the different sections grew and interacted with one another. The scientists then used computer models to apply what they saw in mice to human’s more complex fingerprints, confirming that even minute changes to gene expression during development lead to different patterns."

Latent fingerprints are formed when a finger comes in contact with a surface and the sweat and oil on the skin ridges is transferred to that surface. The friction ridges on the finger surface are lined with pores. As the pores excrete sweat and oil, they coat the skin ridges and can essentially create an invisible patent print. Unlike plastic and patent prints, latent prints are invisible to the unaided eye. Therefore, additional processing is required."
