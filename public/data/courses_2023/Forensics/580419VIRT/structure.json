The appropriate scale for a sketch will fit the scene to the sketch paper. To do this, first identify the longest measurement at the scene, then divide this value by the length of the longest side of the paper. The resulting value will indicate the scale of your sketch. For example, if the largest measurement at the crime scene is 200 feet, and the longest side of your paper is 10 inches, your sketch will fit on the paper if it is at least 20 times smaller than the actual crime scene, or one inch equals 20 feet."
