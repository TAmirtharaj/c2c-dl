Erosion actively occurs in a meandering river’s loops, which are called <button class='glossary-text'>cut banks</button>. In some instances, erosion occurs deep within the meander and forms cutoff areas (or crescent-shaped lakes) known as <button class='glossary-text'>oxbow lakes</button> (circled in Figure 8). Sediment that accumulates next to the river on low-laying ground is known as a <button class='glossary-text'>floodplain</button>. <button class='glossary-text'>Natural levees</button>, which contain the banks of rivers, are formed over time as sediment is deposited on the sides of the stream."

Next, you will trace the landform outline onto transparency paper. Then, you will add 0.5 cm of colored water to the container. Next, you will trace a new outline of the landform at the water level. You will repeat this until you have traced all levels of the landform. Then, you will tape the transparency to a white piece of paper and use a window or light source to trace the topographical map onto the white piece of paper.

Then, you will remove the traced container and place the next container on top of the map. Next, you will trace the next contour line onto the container. You will do this until you have traced all of the contour lines onto containers. Then, you will stack the traced containers in order and photograph the 3-D terrain model you have created.
