The Colorado Plateau was formed through the action of plate tectonics between 70 and 30 million years ago when the whole region was uplifted. About 6 million years ago, the Colorado River began carving out the canyon and further erosion from tributary streams and rain continues to widen the Grand Canyon today. "

The Ancestral Pueblo carved in the limestone near the foot of the Nankoweap Trail, and these are examples of ancient seed- and food-storage facilities that can still be seen there. Although the details of what happened are not well understood, the Ancestral Pueblo civilization collapsed around A.D. 1110. After this, other Native American tribes moved into the canyon. They began migrating between the inner canyon and the upper plateau. Until the mid-1800s eleven tribes called the Grand Canyon home but were forced out as settlers moved west<sup>2</sup>."

Mass wasting usually occurs after weathering and erosion and can play a major role in landform formation. As rocks erode and break down they become less stable. When these rocks are under gravitational stress they become subject to mass wasting. Debris from this process are often deposited into streams or other flowing bodies of water. The streams carrying the fallen debris can modify and chisel the earth’s surface into various landforms. There are different types of mass wasting and different characteristics a scientist would use to classify them. This includes the type of rock, the speed of the material as it moves downward, and how much water is in the material. Despite the role mass wasting has on the natural landscape, in the United States, mass wasting damages can cost over a billion dollars and lead to many deaths a year. The Appalachian and Rocky Mountains along with Alaska and Hawaii experience mass wasting issues more frequently than other areas."

The steepest angle where rock and <button class='glossary-text'>regolith</button> (the layer of loosely arranged sediment covering bedrock) are at rest is known as the <button class='glossary-text'>angle of repose</button>. <span class='bodyFontBold'>Angles of repose</span> can range from 33˚ to 37˚; however, an oversteepened slope can have an angle range of 40˚ to 60˚ (this can vary based on the amount of water in the material and grain size and texture). <button class='glossary-text'>Landslides</button> most likely occur when the angle is 40˚ to 60˚, at which point the gravitational force has won. The landslide shown in Figure 1 occurred in La Conchita, a southern California coastal environment in 1995. This event resulted in evacuation, and homes near the <button class='glossary-text'>slide</button> were lost. Water plays a significant role in mass wasting events. Dry particles will <button class='glossary-text'>fall</button> prey to gravity faster than wet particles because they only rely on friction to keep them bound. Building a sand castle with dry sand is very hard compared to using damp sand. The damp sand exhibits cohesion between its particles and these particles tend to stick together more readily. Too much water can also be troublesome. Excessive rainfall (water) will cause a break down in the cohesion and therefore can lead to landslides. On a microscopic level, water saturation is noted because the water inhabiting spaces between the particles cause the pieces to move farther and farther apart, reducing friction. Think of the damp sand and how easy it is to make the sandcastle. If you added more water to the sand it would become harder for the castle to maintain its form."

Mudflows are mainly comprised of mud but can also carry smaller rocks and occasionally boulders. The speed of debris flow and mudflow is dependent on the water content and slope angle. An increase in water content or increase in slope would lead to a faster moving flow.

Next, you will calculate the area of the mass wasting event. Then, you will record the height of the terrain before and after the mass wasting event.
