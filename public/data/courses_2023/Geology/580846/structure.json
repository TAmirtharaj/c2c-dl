Iceland is a volcanically active island and is made up of <button class='glossary-text'>lithosphere</button> from the North American and Eurasian plates. These two plates are being pushed apart as new crust forms at the mid-Atlantic ridge deep in the Atlantic Ocean. This <button class='glossary-text'>plate boundary</button> continues underneath Iceland, causing the overlying crust to crack. Over the centuries, a canyon has been slowly forming in the national park with rock walls that get a little bit farther away from each other each year. Although the movement of the plates is very small, only about 1 cm a year, it can still be observed by how it shapes the overlying rocks. For instance, a walking path over one part of the continental divide recently collapsed as the crust buckled, opening a deep chasm in the rocks under the path and requiring a new bridge to be built. Because the area sits over the plate boundary, it is also highly geothermically active with hot spring geysers and provides scientists with an opportunity to study the effects of crust changes that would ordinarily require a deep ocean visit."

According to Hess, the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust was consumed in the trenches, new magma rose and erupted along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins were perpetually being “recycled,” with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic <button class='glossary-text'>lithosphere</button> occurring simultaneously. Thus, Hess’s ideas explained why the earth does not get bigger with seafloor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks."

Meanwhile, magma is continually rising along the <span style='whiteSpace: nowrap'><button class='glossary-text'>mid-ocean ridges</button>,</span> where the “recycling” process is completed by the creation of new oceanic crust. This recycling of the seafloor also explained why the oldest fossils found on the seafloor are no more than about 180 million years old. In contrast, marine fossils in rock strata on land—some of which are found high in the Himalayas, over 8,500 m above sea level—can be considerably older. Hess’s ideas also resolved a question that plagued Wegener’s theory of continental drift: how do the continents move? Wegener had a vague notion that the continents must simply “plow” through the ocean floor, which his critics rightly argued was physically impossible. With <button class='glossary-text'>seafloor spreading</button>, the continents did not have to push through the ocean floor but were carried along as the ocean floor spread from the ridges."

A plate boundary is where 2 plates make contact. In some locations, 3 plates come together; these locations are called triple junctions. Plate boundaries are defined and identified by mapping narrow belts of earthquakes, volcanoes, and young mountain ranges. The lithospheric plates rest on the asthenosphere, a zone in the upper mantle that, although solid, has a low rigidity that allows it to flow like a soft plastic. The asthenosphere is the lubricant that facilitates plate movement. Divergent plate boundaries form where plates move away from one another at the axis of submarine mountain ranges called mid-ocean ridges. Convergent plate boundaries form where plates move toward each other, and the oceanic lithosphere of one plate sinks (subducted plate) into the mantle below the other plate (overriding plate) at subduction zones. Transform boundaries form when two plates slide past one another along a vertical fracturing zone called a transform fault.",

Next, calculate the rate of seafloor spreading. Then, compare the rate of sea floor spreading between Australia and Antarctica. Finally, observe the characteristics of types of plate boundaries. In Activity 2, print the map of plates and measure the length of the scale. Then, measure the distance across an anomaly and calculate its spreading rate. Repeat the last 2 steps for both plates on the map. Next, measure the distance to the furthest magnetic anomaly on the scale. Then, determine the age of the anomaly and calculate the spreading half rate. Next, calculate the total spreading rate. Repeat the last 4 steps for both ridges on the map. Then, continue to Activity 3.",

Repeat the last 2 steps for both plates on the map. Next, measure the distance to the furthest magnetic anomaly on the scale.
