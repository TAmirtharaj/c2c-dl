Predicting exactly how much sea level will rise and in which areas is complicated by a number of factors related to <button class='glossary-text'>density</button> and Earth’s structure.  Sea levels rise through two main mechanisms-thermal expansion of water and increased water from melting land ice. When water increases in temperature, its density decreases and volume increases, causing sea levels to rise relative to the land area. Similarly, when land ice melts and runs into oceans, this increases the amount of water and raises sea levels. Interestingly, melting icebergs and sea ice sheets does not raise sea levels because the ice has already displaced the volume of water it would occupy once melted. However, while the water levels are changing, the land area is also changing. When ice melts off land, it changes the mass and density of the land, which can lead to isostatic rebound, or the lithospheric plate floating higher on the <button class='glossary-text'>asthenosphere</button> than before. This could potentially offset some of the effects of sea level rise. Unfortunately, these two processes rarely occur at the same rate or in the same locations, so isostatic rebound is unlikely to prevent much of the anticipated damage from sea level rise. These interconnected processes make it important to model future sea level rise to help communities prepare for coming changes."

Then, as the earth began to cool and solidify, the materials became trapped at their new density-stratified levels in a vertical distribution that found heavy metals—like nickel, iron, and lead—concentrated at the center of the earth and lighter elements—such as silicon, sodium, and calcium—concentrated at the surface of the earth. This is not to say that lighter elements are not found at the center of the earth and heavy metals are not found at the surface, but they are in highest concentrations in their respective layers."

Consider an iceberg (Figure 4), noticing how a large percentage of the iceberg’s mass is below the waterline. The same is true of the lithosphere as it “floats” in the asthenosphere. What rides above the top of the asthenosphere is just a portion of the total lithospheric volume. In fact, the portion sunk into the asthenosphere is often the most voluminous. Since oceanic lithosphere is relatively thin and dense, only a small portion is protruding from the asthenosphere, thus contributing to an overall low elevation. On the other hand, thick, less dense continental crust will have a much higher elevation. Mountains appear most like icebergs on the asthenosphere, with deep roots sinking farther to compensate for the additional mass of the mountain."
