Much of this decrease is caused by melting snow and ice cover in the arctic, Antarctic, and from mountain glaciers; but other factors, like land use, also play a role. "

Some preliminary research says yes<sup class='bodySupscript'>1</sup>. Scientists determined that crops like winter-sown barely had almost twice the albedo of bare soil, and that summer oats can decrease the amount of radiation absorbed in a localized area. While more research still needs to be done, the scientists are hopeful that modifying when and where certain crops are planted can help to increase albedo, decrease local temperatures, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Both the rate at which water flows through soil and the amount of water retained by soil are very important for access and overall plant growth. In either extreme of flow or retention, plants will not grow well. Characteristics like soil particle size, the physical properties of water, and their interaction are what influence the conditions that affect water availability for plants."

If temperatures are too low, growth is slow; if temperatures are too high, important processes—such as photosynthesis—do not function. The effect of soil temperature on plant growth is twofold: it directly affects plant growth rate and germination, and indirectly affects plant growth by affecting nutrient solubility and the activity of microbes that support plant growth. For some plants, such as the lodgepole pine, germination can even be triggered by the extreme heat of fire (see Figure 1). Temperature also impacts nutrient availability. Generally, as temperature increases, chemical weathering of minerals accelerates, and nutrients in these minerals then dissolve into the soil solution faster as the soil warms."

Hence, water flows fastest between sand particles, followed by silt, and finally clay. The rate of water flow also depends on matric potential. This is because water can only flow through water-filled pores. As soil pores fill with water, the water can flow through a better-connected network of pores and take a more direct path through the soil (Figure 3). As the soil drains, the water must take a more winding path through the soil, adhering to individual particles through fewer and less-connected water-filled pores, slowing down the water flow rate. Thus, water flow rate increases as moisture and matric potential increase.",

Many factors affect how much radiation reaches the soil, including: latitude, climate, albedo, slope angle, and aspect. Incoming solar radiation increases with decreasing latitude, and so land closer to the equator receives more hours of sunlight and more direct sunlight compared with land closer to the poles. Humid regions receive less solar radiation than dry regions because water vapor absorbs solar radiation, and clouds reflect it. Both absorption and reflection of radiation by the atmosphere reduces the amount reaching the soil. Light-colored and snow-covered soils have a much higher albedo compared with darker, exposed soils. Thus, darker soils, when not covered by snow, absorb more radiation, and heat up faster than light colored or snow-covered soils. The location of soil on a slope also affects the amount of solar radiation it absorbs."

During a hot day, soil temperature therefore generally decreases with increasing depth (see Figure 4) for hypothetical soil temperature trends over time in a warm, dry climate). During a cold night, however, temperature generally increases with increasing depth, as the deeper soil layers are more protected from the cold evening air. Deeper layers of soil also tend to take longer to heat up and cool down, as the heat must travel through more layers to enter or exit the soil. This delay in peak and trough temperatures is called lag time. Adding mulch or gravel to soil effectively adds an extra layer of “blanket”, insulating the soil further, and increasing the lag time."

Next, you will record the time to the first drop of water passing through the filter and then continue recording the time and volume of water passing through the filter. Then, you will cover the cup and filter with a plastic bag and wait 24 hours. Next, you will record the final filtered water volume. Repeat this procedure for the other sample. In activity 2, you will remove the plastic bag from the filter and record the mass of the filter and soil. Then, you will allow the soil to dry on newspaper until it feels dry. Next, you will record the mass of the dry soil and calculate the soil moisture. You will then proceed to activity 3."

After completing activity 2, in activity 3, you will decide on your test sites and mark your thermometer. Then, you will draw a map of the soil locations and photograph your test sites. Next, you will insert your thermometer to the given depth, wait 2 minutes, then remove the thermometer and record the temperature. You will do this at all your test sites at soil depths of 1, 2, 4, and 6 centimeters. In Activity 4, you will create a spreadsheet workbook table and enter water drainage data into it. Then you will create a graph from the data. This process is repeated for each data set from Activity 2."
