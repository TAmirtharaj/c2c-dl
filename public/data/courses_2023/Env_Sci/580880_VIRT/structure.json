You might also imagine that high biodiversity is only found in pristine, protected lands, free from human interference. But it turns out that biodiversity can be found in some very surprising locations. New research suggests that graveyards and burial grounds can be small hotspots of biodiversity<sup>1</sup>. According to the researchers, graveyards, especially those on the edges of cultivated farmland or in urban areas, can provide safe havens for <button class='glossary-text'>endangered species</button> that have been wiped out in the surrounding areas. Because graveyards are relatively undisturbed, native grasses and wildflowers may be allowed to grow, which can provide important food sources for pollinators like bees and butterflies, which in turn can benefit nearby crops. In most areas, graveyards are already protected from destruction because of their significance to human communities, meaning that they can continue to be havens for many <button class='glossary-text'>species</button>."

The locals are having a hard time fishing as the sea slug eats the same algae the native fish rely on as their main food source.",
