It supplies freshwater to much of the Great Plains, providing not only the drinking water for cities in this area, but also support for the area's main industry, agriculture. The land in this area is intensely farmed, growing approximately 20% of the world's grain and supporting almost 40% of its cattle grazing<sup>1</sup>. Without the Ogallala Aquifer, agriculture would not be sustainable in this area because surface water is relatively rare, and rainfall is limited. In fact, agricultural overuse of surface water in this area was one of the contributing factors to the dust bowl. But, despite its size, this aquifer is in danger. Each year we draw far more water from it than can be replenished in the same timeframe. Additionally, <button class='glossary-text'>recharge zones</button> are rare due to the type of soil in the region and many of these areas have either been threatened or destroyed by converting land for farming or development. To avoid a catastrophe, many agricultural scientists are trying to find ways to grow food more efficiently in the region using less water. Some of these strategies include genetically engineered crops that use less water, planting crops to avoid evaporation, drip irrigation, and protecting and restoring wetlands to allow for more recharge and surface water."

In activity 2, reset the reservoir. Then, set up the discharge pipe and refill the reservoir with water. Next, make the pollutant mix from the Kool Aid, inject it into the discharge pipe and observe the water in the reservoir. Then, measure the ground water in the wells and observe for polluted water repeating 3 times at 1-minute intervals. Next, reset the model. In activity 3, set up the container with wells, sand, gravel and clay. Then, dig a hole in the sand and add water. Add Kool Aid as fertilizer and water from the cup as rain. Next, observe the movement of color. After 30 seconds, remove water from the upstream and downstream wells and observe.",
