The growth of primary producers (and, by extension, all organisms throughout a food web) in any environment is limited by the scarcity of a resource. That resource can be physical, such as light or space, or it can be a nutrient. In terrestrial and freshwater environments, nitrogen or phosphorous are often limiting nutrients. Most fertilizers contain nitrogen and phosphorus as water-soluble nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and phosphates (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup><sup>-</sup>). Rain washes these water-soluble nitrates and phosphates from cultivated land into surface waters where they promote the rapid growth of plants and algae, which speeds up the rate of <button class='glossary-text'>eutrophication</button>. Eutrophication is a natural, usually gradual process that increases sediment and nutrient availability in water bodies. Human activities, however, can lead to cultural, or human-induced, eutrophication which can speed up this normally gradual process. Fertilizer runoff from lawns and farms, inadequately treated municipal wastewater, and poorly maintained septic systems all contribute to cultural eutrophication. In agricultural areas with dense animal populations, animal waste adds nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters as well."

It modifies the solubility of oxygen in water, the rate of photosynthesis in aquatic plants, the metabolic rate of aquatic organisms, and the susceptibility of aquatic species to toxins and disease. Water temperature varies naturally with season and depth, but human activity also can affect temperature in significant ways. For example, heated water from surfaces such as sunlit parking lots, roads, sidewalks, and from industrial processes that use water as a coolant can flow into nearby creeks, streams, or rivers. This thermal pollution can destroy some types of aquatic life. Water loses heat very slowly, so thermally polluted water should be given significant dilution and time to cool before discharged into natural surface waters. Heated water also facilitates the rapid growth of some aquatic plants and algae, so thermal pollution can accelerate the rate of cultural eutrophication."

Much of the DO in water comes from the atmosphere. Atmospheric oxygen dissolves via diffusion into the water at the surface. Wind and waves stir the water, which dilutes the DO concentration at the surface by mixing, and subsequently increases the amount of oxygen that can dissolve at the surface. Another important source of oxygen in water is photosynthesis performed by aquatic plants and algae. Some of these aquatic photosynthetic organisms are rooted or attached to the streambed, whereas others are planktonic (live in the water column). The amount of photosynthetically generated DO in the water typically peaks in the afternoon when the sun reaches zenith and the most light penetrates the water. <button class='glossary-text'>Turbidity</button>, or murkiness resulting from a large number of particles in the water, can lower DO levels by reducing photosynthetic rates due to limited light penetration."

The presence of large numbers of coliforms in a water sample is a good indication that animal or human waste has polluted the water. Most coliforms do not cause disease, except for a few Escherichia coli strains. However, many pathogenic bacteria and parasites are spread through feces (e.g., those causing typhoid fever, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, and dysentery), and the presence of coliforms indicates that harmful pathogens might be present as well.

Calcium and magnesium are two minerals commonly dissolved in water. A water-insoluble carbonate forms when aqueous calcium or magnesium hydrogen carbonate is heated. Industrial boilers reach high temperatures and generate solid deposits of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate, commonly called scale. These water-insoluble deposits reduce the efficiency of machines and are expensive to remove.

In this exercise, a modified turbidity tube will be used. A water sample is drained from the tube slowly, and the black and white pattern of a Secchi disk at the bottom of the tube becomes visible.

Oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, and they mix with atmospheric water and form nitric and sulfuric acids. These acids are mixed with rainwater and delivered to natural waterways and soils. Normal rain has a pH of 5.6 due to dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere forming carbonic acid. Rain is known as acidic if the pH is lower than 5.6."

A sudden or drastic pH change will kill some of these organisms or reduce survival and reproduction, which disrupts food webs and the aquatic community. Lower pH levels can also release heavy metals from the surrounding bedrock into the water. Once dissolved, these metals can interfere with the uptake of dissolved oxygen by aquatic organisms."

If you are conducting activities 3-6 on site, continue to activity 3. If not, transport your sample home in a cooler, then continue to activity 3. In activity 3, you will add a drop of ample water to the pH paper, compare it to the color chart and record the water pH.  In activity 4, fill the conical tube with sample water, add the LaMotte® Phosphorus TesTab® to the tube and mix the contents.

In activity 6, fill the graduated cylinder with 100 mL of water. Then, remove the cylinder from its base and place it over the 0 NTU pattern. Next, observe the pattern through the water. If the pattern is observable, compare the appearance of the 0 NTU pattern through the water to each unobstructed disk and find the closest match to estimate the turbidity value. If the pattern is not observable through 100 mL of water, pour off 5 mL of water and observe the 0 NTU pattern again. Keep doing this until the pattern is visible.
