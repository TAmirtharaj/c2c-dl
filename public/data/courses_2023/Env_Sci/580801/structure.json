Unfortunately, coral is also one of the organisms that is most susceptible to the negative consequences of increased <button class='glossary-text'>greenhouse gases</button>. As global CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, the oceans become not only more acidic, but also warmer. Increased acidity dissolves the calcium carbonate matrix that corals secrete, which makes up most of the structure of the reef, thus making it harder for the coral to lay down new skeletons as they grow.  Corals are animals that contain mutualistic, photosynthetic zooxanthellae within them, providing much of the energy to the coral and the rest of the ecosystem. However, these zooxanthellae are very sensitive to temperature changes. Even a small increase in ocean temperatures can cause them to die off, leaving the coral nutrient deficient. The coral subsequently dies. What remains is the white calcium carbonate skeleton, a phenomenon called coral reef bleaching.<span class='bodyParaLineBreak'>Coral reefs also directly benefit humans. They help dissipate the energy of hurricanes and protect coastlines from potentially deadly storm surges.

However, the scientific concepts behind the theory are not new. In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier was the first to recognize that, given the earth’s size and distance from the sun, the planet’s surface temperature should be considerably cooler than it was. He proposed several mechanisms to explain why the earth was warmer than his calculations predicted, one of which was that the earth’s atmosphere might act as an insulator. Forty years later, John Tyndall demonstrated that different gases have different capacities to absorb infrared radiation, most notably methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), all of which are present in the atmosphere. In 1896, Svante Arrhenius developed the first mathematical <button class='glossary-text'>model</button>  of the effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels on temperature. His model predicted that a doubling of the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would produce a 5 to 6° C increase in temperature globally. Based on the level of CO<sub>2</sub> production in the late 19th century, he predicted that this change would take place over thousands of years, if at all. Arrhenius used Arvid Högbom’s calculations of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in his equations. Högbom thought that the excess CO<sub>2</sub> would be absorbed by the ocean; others believed that the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> was insignificant next to the much larger effect of water vapor."

Trace gases include methane, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), CO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (e.g., NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>). Water vapor is not usually included in the composition of gases in the atmosphere because it varies widely, from 0% to 4%, depending on location. The concentration of gases in the atmosphere is not uniform either; the atmosphere consists of several concentric layers. Some gases are concentrated at certain altitudes. Water is concentrated near Earth’s surface, for instance, and ozone is concentrated 20 to 30 kilometers above the surface. Transfer of energy from the sun at and near the surface of the earth is responsible for weather and climate. Solar radiation heats land, the oceans, and atmospheric gases differently, resulting in the constant transfer of energy across the globe."

The first is the angle at which the sun’s light hits the earth. Where the sun is directly overhead, as it is at the equator, the light is direct. Each square mile of incoming sunlight hits one square mile of the earth. At higher latitudes, the sun hits at an angle, spreading the one square mile of sunlight over more of Earth’s surface. Thus, the intensity of the light is reduced and the surface does not warm as quickly (see Figure 1). This causes the tropics, near the equator, to be warmer and the poles to be cooler."

Whereas the melting of sea ice can have complex consequences due to the different densities of salt and fresh water, it will not cause sea level rise. Melting of glaciers and the deep ice over the Antarctic continent, however, can. The second cause of sea level rise, related to warmer temperatures, is that water slightly expands as it warms. As the oceans warm, the water rises farther up the shore. Countries and cities that have large portions of their land area at or just above sea level may be in jeopardy."

River systems may be overwhelmed by increased runoff rates, which can cause flooding. One of the richest agricultural regions in the world, California, depends heavily on snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, and one of the world’s most populous river valleys, the Indus, is equally dependent on snowmelt from the Himalayas."

Then, trim the map to the next contour line and repeat the process until your island has 4 layers.  In activity 2, prepare the salt water. Then, place the colored ice cube in the plastic tray and add the salt water, Next, estimate the initial water depth. Then, place coins on the island and estimate the depth of the water every 10 minutes until the ice has completely melted. Finally, observe if the coins are underwater before removing them and draining the water from the tray. Then continue to activity 3.",
