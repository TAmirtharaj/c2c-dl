Usually, salt makes it more challenging for the plants to grow and can even render the soil completely inhospitable to the plants that once flourished there. Salt can infiltrate the soil when aquifers are overdrawn or when coastal wetlands are destroyed, leading to seawater seeping into new environments. However, while most plants are harmed by salt, some plants, like mangroves, have evolved to grow in high salinity environments. Mangroves, which live in tropical salt marshes, have many adaptations which allow them to deal with the <button class='glossary-text'>osmotic stress</button> of high salt. Their roots have both barriers to inhibit salt uptake in the form of thick Casparian strips, and specialized glands which actively pump out salt when concentrations get too high. The genes which allow for these adaptations have been identified and some scientists are hoping to create transgenic species of rice and other food crops with these genes<sup>1</sup>. This might allow these plants to once again grow in areas where the soil has been damaged by salt infiltration."

In chemistry, opposite charges attract. Table salt (NaCl), for example, is comprised of oppositely charged ions: the cation Na<sup>+</sup> (sodium) has a positive charge, and the anion Cl<sup>-</sup> (chloride) has a negative charge. In table salt, Na<sup>+</sup> is attracted to Cl<sup>-</sup> because they are oppositely charged. Soil clay particles are predominately composed of layered silicate minerals that usually carry a negative surface charge. The charge originates predominately from oxygen atoms, which are <button class='glossary-text'>electronegative</button>, meaning they attract electrons (e<sup>-</sup>) from other atoms, and therefore tend to develop a negative charge. When the negative charge of the oxygen in a mineral is greater than the positive charges of cations (such as Al<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>), an overall negative surface charge develops. The charge can be diffused (i.e., spread out over the whole surface), or localized to specific negatively charged oxygen on the surface, called <button class='glossary-text'>negative charge sites</button>. This negative surface charge, like Cl<sup>-</sup>, attracts cations like Na<sup>+</sup> from the soil solution."

These are highly weathered minerals, and hence tend to be more abundant in more weathered soils. Along with organic matter, the surface charges of these minerals go from positive at low pH to more negative at high pH. This occurs because as soil pH decreases, the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in the soil solution increases. These H<sup>+</sup> then adsorb to <button class='glossary-text'>negative charge sites</button> so strongly that those sites develop an overall positive charge. This positive charge then attracts oppositely charged anions such as Cl<sup>+</sup>, NO3<sup>+</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from the soil solution.

If the color does not match, you will add more ammonium. If it does match, you will label your test tubes and cups, and add the ammonium solution to the control. Then, you will measure the soil, add it to the tube, add the ammonium, cover the tube with parafilm, mix it, and let the tube sit. Next, you will filter the soil through the filter apparatus. If the sample is cloudy, you will wait 24 hours and then filter the sample again. When the filtrate is no longer cloudy, you will pour the filtrate into a test tube, test the filtrate with a test strip, and compare it to the color chart.
