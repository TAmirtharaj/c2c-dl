Needs of an expanding population include agriculture, industry, commerce, recreation, and living spaces. All these purposes have various needs from the environment, which comes down to the soils and structure of the location. Some uses are appropriate for some soils but not for others. In addition, some soils may support multiple uses, and knowing soil properties helps us identify optimal uses and balance the needs of local communities with the ability of soils to support those needs. A <button class='glossary-text'>soil survey</button> is the most comprehensive way to evaluate the properties of a landscape and thus evaluate the most suitable use.

They need to get detailed soil profiles to make sure the soil will not deform under the weight of the building; and based on the soil properties, they build foundations that take into account the type and consistency of the area. When these factors are not considered, the consequences can be dramatic. One of the most famous examples of this is the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy. The tower’s construction was completed in 1370, but the tower began to lean almost as soon as construction began 200 years earlier. While blame has gone back and forth over the centuries, whether it was the architect’s fault or the fault of the soil, most modern-day analysts believe the soil profile played a significant role in the tower’s tilt. The soil beneath the tower has layers of incompressible clay with a layer of sandy silt on top that was thicker on one side than the other. The tower’s foundation was too small and shallow to counteract this difference and the tower began to lean. Recent efforts have been made to stabilize the tower from tilting any further while still preserving the characteristic lean of this world-famous landmark."

With a growing population, determination of land use is important. Some land is suitable for multiple uses; thus choices must be made based on climate and local needs. For example, the soil in a flat grassy valley has the structure to support building developments and roads for commerce but is also fertile for agriculture; the needs for food security may prioritize that land for agriculture. Areas also suitable for agriculture are river deltas, which are rich in minerals <button class='glossary-text'>deposited</button> from years of sedimentation. However, farming in these areas could damage the land’s ability to provide buffering from coastal storms.

Describing water flow, drainage, and the landscapes from which they travel can inform how sediments came to be <button class='glossary-text'>deposited</button> in a location. The origin of a river in a specific mountain range, the type of rock material it cuts through along with the slope, and the valley it runs through and depositing sediment material along the way are valuable in determining the parent material of a soil. In regions formerly covered in glaciers, such as much of the Midwestern US, glacier-deposited sediments, called glacial till, are also common. Glacial till contains a diverse mixture of rocks reflecting the rocks that the glacier eroded before it melted. Glaciers also grind up sediment into a fine sediment, and some of these particles can be picked up by the wind. Such wind-deposited silt particles (0.002–0.05 mm in diameter) are called loess. Wind can also move sand particles (0.05–2 mm in diameter) previously deposited by rivers and the ocean, creating sand dunes from which soil may eventually form. Geology can be thought of how major historic events shape the rocks and soils around us. By examining the geologic timeline, we see how both the evolution of life over millions of years and <button class='glossary-text'>geographical events</button> shape the composition and structure of our landforms (see Figure 4)."

In addition, the presence of water is necessary for many chemical reactions; thus, in the presence of water, chemical weathering occurs. Other chemical weathering reactions include acid-base reactions facilitated by organisms.
