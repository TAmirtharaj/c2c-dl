However, bacterial bioremediation can be a slow process as the bacteria need time to grow, lots of available nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous, and are limited by the surface area of the oil slick. As oil is extremely hydrophobic, it does not mix with water; instead, it sticks to itself, limiting the surface area to which the bacteria can attach.  Often, chemical surfactants or dispersants are added to the oil to increase its surface area, but these chemicals can be harmful to nearby wildlife. Scientists are now experimenting with nano particles to help bacteria be more effective at cleaning up oil spills<sup>1</sup>. They can assist bacteria in a variety of ways, such as emulsifying the oil to increase its surface area for bacterial attachment or adding additional nutrients to a targeted area. Nanoparticles can even create a magnetic coating on the oil to make it easier to remove. "

Dramatic accidents and oil spills—like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster (also known as the BP oil disaster)—make headline news. The oil that spilled during the Deepwater Horizon disaster, for example, decimated bird and fish populations and resulted in the deaths of dolphins, turtles, and deepwater corals. It also negatively impacted the commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Likewise, the harmful effects of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill are still felt in Alaska’s Prince William Sound, more than a quarter century after the tanker ran aground and spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil."

The vast majority of ocean oil contamination originates from the accumulation of smaller, less publicized but commonplace events, such as leaks from smaller oil tankers, routine operation of oceanic oil wells, leaking storage tanks and pipelines for offshore oil wells, and improperly drilled holes in the ocean floor. Loading and unloading tankers with oil for transfer from offshore rigs to onshore sites also can introduce oil into the ocean. Refined oil (i.e., fuel oil, gasoline, and other processed petroleum products) from municipal and industrial sources is often accidentally or deliberately dumped, spilled, or leaked on land and into waterways. Oil on roadways from motor vehicles is carried to waterways and eventually to the ocean by heavy rainfalls. Many people also dispose of used motor oil improperly. This oil can enter storm drains, streams, and rivers and can be carried out to sea. Oil can also enter the atmosphere as smoke from oil fires and then be deposited into the ocean and tributaries through precipitation."

A hydrocarbon is a chemical compound made entirely of carbon and hydrogen that usually forms a long chain, which can be either linear or in the form of a ring (see Figure 2). The toxic chemicals floating in oil can kill or contaminate plankton and algae. When fish eat these contaminated foods, they can also become contaminated or even die. Fish larvae can be killed, sickened, or disfigured, negatively impacting future population numbers. The larvae that survive likely continue to consume oil as well. These compounds are often transferred through an entire food web and can become more concentrated (have a higher potency) when larger fish, birds, animals, and humans prey on these contaminated fish. This process is referred to as <button class='glossary-text'>bioaccumulation</button>. Heavy oil components sink to the ocean floor where they cover benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms, such as crabs, oysters, mussels, and clams. The toxicity of the oil either kills these organisms or penetrates their tissues, making them dangerous to consume. Oil also coats the feathers of birds and the fur of marine mammals, causing them to lose their natural insulation, buoyancy, and motility. Many of these animals drown; others die due to loss of body heat."

In activity 1, you will label the tubes. Then you will add tetrazolium, distilled water, oil and microbial solutions to the tubes as designated. Next, you will add the components and set up the experimental tubes. Then, you will cap and mix each tube and record your observations about the appearance of the oil. Next, you will gently loosen the cap of each tube and incubate for 24 hours. Then, recap and observe the tubes. This process of loosening the tube caps, incubating, and observing is repeated through Day 3.",
