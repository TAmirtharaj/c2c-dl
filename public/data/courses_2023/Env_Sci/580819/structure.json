Streams carry sediment from their sources, much of which is deposited into these formations. This sediment contains high levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, as well as decomposing organic matter, which all gets concentrated in the delta as it is continually deposited. While these areas are important for natural ecosystems, they have also played a large role in human history. Many of the first human civilizations sprang up round river deltas. The Tigris and Euphrates deltas and the Nile delta were some of earliest settled areas. Additionally, river deltas of the Indus, Yangtze, Mississippi, and many others were home to early civilizations in their areas. These deltas provided the nutrients key for the development of early farming, while wide <button class='glossary-text'>floodplains</button> deposited new nutrients every season. Without this, early farmers would not have been able to produce enough food for the development of cities. Today, many of these areas are threatened by human activities.  Damming upstream limits sediment reaching the delta, overdraw for irrigation causes reduces flow, intensive farming causes <button class='glossary-text'>erosion</button>, and development of the surrounding land leads to pollution - all of which endanger the river deltas and could harm the human cities they helped foster."

Understanding the flow of a stream can help to determine when and how much water reaches other areas of a watershed. For example, one of the leading causes of pollution in most waterways across the United States is excessive nutrient and sediment overloading from runoff from the landmasses surrounding these waterways. Nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen are prevalent in fertilizers that wash off lawns and farms into surrounding sewer and water systems. This process can cause the overproduction of algae, which are further degraded by bacteria. These bacteria then take up the surrounding oxygen for respiration and kill multiple plants and organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the interaction between streams and the land as they move downstream to other areas of a watershed can help us to prevent pollution. One example of this is to build a <button class='glossary-text'>buffer</button>, which is a group of plants that can be grown along parts of the stream bank that are more susceptible to pollution and can absorb excessive nutrients; this therefore lessens the effects of nutrient overloading in the streambed."

This can create problems for natural vegetation growth because of the obstruction of light and prevent animals from visibly finding their prey. <button class='glossary-text'>Erosion</button> also has considerable effects on stream health. Erosion, or the removal of material (soil, rock, or sand) from the earth to another location, is caused by actions such as physical and chemical weathering. These two processes loosen rocks and other materials, and can move these sediments to other locations through bodies of water. Once these particles reach their final destination, they are considered to be deposited. <button class='glossary-text'>Deposition</button> is also an important process because where the sediment particles end up can greatly impact the shape of the land and how water is distributed throughout the system. Erosion and deposition can occur multiple times along the length of a stream and can vary because of extreme weather such as flooding or high-wind events. Over time, these two processes can completely reshape an area, causing the topography, or the physical features, of an entire <button class='glossary-text'>watershed</button> to be altered. Depending on weather conditions, a streambed can be altered very quickly. Faster-moving water tends to erode more sediment than it deposits sediment. Deposition usually occurs in slowermoving water. With less force acting on the sediment, it falls out of suspension and builds up on the bottom or sides of the streambed."

They are both fan-shaped accumulations of sediment that form when the stream shape changes. Deltas form in continuous, flowing water at the mouth of streams, whereas alluvial fans only form in streams that flow intermittently (when it rains or when snow melts). Alluvial fans are usually composed of larger particles and will form in canyons and valleys as water accumulates in these regions. The fan shape of both deposits is easy to spot from a distance, as they are formed due to the sand settling out on the bottom of the streams."

Discharge and <button class='glossary-text'>velocity</button> (the speed of the water moving in the stream), are both vital to the shaping of streambeds. Within stream ecosystems, there are microhabitats (smaller habitats making up larger habitats) that have different discharges and velocities. The type of microhabitat depends on the width of that part of the stream, the shape of the streambed, and many other physical factors. In areas that contain riffles, water quickly splashes over shallow, rocky areas, which are easily observed in sunny areas (See <span class='bodyFontBold'>Figure 1</span>). Deeper pools of slower-moving water also form on the outside of the bends of the streams, as shown in <span class='bodyFontBold'>Figure 1</span>. Runs, which are deeper than riffles but have a moderate current, connect riffles and pools throughout the stream. The source of a stream is where it begins, while the mouth of a stream is where it discharges into a lake or the ocean.</span>"

Fishing for human consumption is another large, worldwide industry that depends on stream health; keeping streams pristine and understanding how they form are of utmost importance in sustaining this top food industry.

While the stream table made in this lab is not a “to-size” stream and landscape, the same processes can be more easily observed at a scaled-down size. Scientists frequently create models to simplify complex processes for easier understanding. For example, to physically observe something that is too big, such as how far each planet in the solar system is from one another, the spatial distance can be scaled to create a solar system model. By changing the distance between each planet (from kilometers to centimeters), this large system is now more feasibly observed. Similarly, the stream model allows us to physically view different scenarios of a streambed and analyze different stream properties. Mathematical equations are also used frequently to observe data in order to predict future conditions, such as in meteorological models. Ultimately, models are a very important key for predicting future events and analyzing processes that occur in a system.</span>"

Next, you will observe and photograph the steam, measure its dimensions and calculate the physical stream values. You will repeat this for 3 trials, then change the slope of the tray by using a different book. You will repeat the process for 3 more trials at this height.  In activity 2, you will design a new procedure testing the effect of a new variable on stream formation. Then you will form a hypothesis and perform 3 trials of your experiment.",
