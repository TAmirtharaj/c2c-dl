The most dangerous components of these waste chemicals are nitrogen and phosphorus. These elements are vital nutrients for photosynthetic algae, just like they are for crops. In the presence of these chemicals, the algae grow at an exponential rate, creating algal blooms so large they can sometimes be seen from space. <span class='bodyParaLineBreak'>In 2018, an annual algal bloom called the great Atlantic sargassum belt became the largest algal bloom ever recorded. It spanned 5,000 miles, from the coast of West Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. Although sargassum blooms serve as an important refuge for hundreds of marine species, super-sized blooms harm coastal biodiversity, fisheries, the tourism industry, and human health. As the 2018 bloom decayed on beaches around the world, its effects on the Caribbean country of Barbados were so devastating it declared a national emergency. It is predicted the great Atlantic sargassum belt will continue to increase in size due to climate change, changing ocean currents, and the continued use of agricultural and industrial chemicals."

Rounded, granular peds are particularly suitable for plant growth because their structure easily permits penetration by air, water, and roots. Clay and loamy soils often have blocky peds that are angular and somewhat irregular in shape and permit the flow of air and water. In platy peds, however, some passageways are blocked because the soil particles are tightly packed. A platy soil usually has high clay content and often occurs in areas that are frequently flooded.

Soil must retain water and permit root penetration to support plant life. However, certain particle sizes and arrangements of particles allow for permeability conditions that could be detrimental to agriculture. Therefore, particle size and arrangement need to be identified to determine proper soil usage. <button class='glossary-text'>Porosity</button> is the amount of void space between individual soil particles. With high porosity between particles, a greater volume of water can permeate but might also waterlog certain systems. Porosity is another major property of soil that has a significant effect on water infiltration and <button class='glossary-text'>soil fertility</button>, or the ability of soil to hold sufficient nutrients for plant growth. In the following section, nutrient availability and chemical composition-and their effects on different soil types-are discussed."

Since it is not retained by soil, excess nitrogen can leach onto the surface or into groundwater, causing algal blooms and a loss of oxygen.
