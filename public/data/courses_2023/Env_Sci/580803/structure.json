On Earth, thankfully, acid rain is a relatively rare phenomenon which scientists have been working to remediate for decades. On Venus, however, acid rain forms continually in the upper atmosphere. Because Venus has extensive volcanic activity, compounds such as sulfur dioxide gas are constantly released into the atmosphere; on Earth, these are released in small quantities from fossil fuel consumption. These compounds mix with water vapor to form sulfuric acid. Unlike Earth, the surface of Venus is about 480 Â°C, thanks to its intensive greenhouse effect, which is too hot for liquid precipitation to fall; instead, the acid rain evaporates and persists in clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. Observing these weather patterns on Venus gives scientists a good idea of what the worst-case scenario could be on Earth if higher quantities of pollutants are released into the atmosphere or if greenhouse gas levels rise considerably<sup>1</sup>."

It damages the leaves and bark of trees, impairing the ability of trees to photosynthesize, leaving them vulnerable to insects and disease. The acid burns leaves by removing the outer coating, leaving brown spots. Acid deposition also leaches nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, from the soil, depriving already weakened trees of essential minerals. Acid also releases aluminum ions, that were once attached to minerals, into the soil, potentially damaging plant roots. Trees at higher elevations are especially susceptible, because cloud vapor can be 10 to 100 times more acidic than acid rain and can bathe trees in acid for days at a time.

As fish and amphibians develop, their eggs are particularly sensitive to changes in pH. Although tolerance varies by species, fish eggs generally will not hatch in water with a pH of 5 or lower. Suboptimal pH is not necessarily lethal, but it often leads to lower body weight and smaller size, making fish more vulnerable to predation and less able to compete for food. As previously stated, acid deposition releases aluminum ions that are separated from minerals in nearby soils. When these ions enter the surface waters, they stimulate excessive mucus formation in fish. This mucus clogs gills and ultimately asphyxiates many types of fish. A decline in the number of pH-sensitive organisms can significantly disrupt an ecosystem and seriously affect the food web."

Acid deposition also leaches nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, from the soil, depriving already weakened trees of essential minerals. Many ancient statues and buildings are made of marble and limestone, two forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) which dissolve easily in acid.

However, some soils and water systems are better able to resist changes in pH.

In activity 1, you will add the filter paper to the 4 Petri dishes, wet the filter papers with the designated pH solution and place the seeds in each dish. Then, you will allow the seeds to germinate. You will then record the number of seeds that have been germinated each day for 3 days. In activity 2, you will prepare by collecting 2 different soil samples. Then, you will determine the buffering capacity of bottled water. Next, you will mix each soil sample with bottled water and allow the mixtures to settle overnight. Then, you will decant the eluent from each soil sample. Finally, you will determine the buffering capacity of each soil sample. ",
