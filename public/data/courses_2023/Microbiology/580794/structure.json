However, some bacteria are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. <span className=bodyParaLineBreak>In 1999, Heide Schulz was examining sediment cores from the ocean. The cores came from 300 feet below the waters near the Namibia's Skeleton Coast. In the samples, she noticed “pearl”-like organisms<sup class='bodySupscript'>1</sup>. When she looked at these structures under a microscope, she discovered that they were not pearls, but rather giant bacteria. The researchers named the new microbe the \"Sulfur pearl of Namibia,\" <i>Thiomargarita namibiensis</i>. The cells are <span style='whiteSpace: nowrap'>three-quarters</span> of a millimeter in diameter, and they use sulfide and nitrate as their nutrient source. The sediment in the ocean is low in nutrients and only when occasional storms occur are nutrients stirred up and replenished.

However, when magnified, the depth of the material on the slide becomes more apparent.

Depth of field is shallower on high power than on low power. In other words, when you view an object under high power, less of it is in focus at one time than when the same object is viewed under low power.
