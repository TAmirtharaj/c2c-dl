                  "body": "Lysozyme was discovered in 1922 by Dr. Alexander Fleming, who several years later discovered an antibacterial mold from which he derived the antibiotic drug penicillin. Fleming was working in his laboratory while suffering from a cold and decided to apply some of his nasal mucus to a bacterial culture in a Petri dish. Weeks later, he examined the culture and noticed that, although the culture was generally growing well, the area to which he had applied mucus lacked bacterial growth. Lysozyme attacks peptidoglycan, a complex polymer of amino acids and sugars that is an important component of the bacterial cell wall. An intact cell wall allows a bacterium to survive osmotic and mechanical challenges. By weakening the cell wall, lysozyme makes the bacterium much more likely to lyse, or burst open. However, not all bacteria are equally susceptible to lysozyme. Gram-negative bacteria in particular are less affected because their cell walls contain much less peptidoglycan than those of Gram-positive bacteria. "
