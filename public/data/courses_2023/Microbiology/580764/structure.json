The cytoplasm within a cell is an aqueous solution, and its water and solute content must be maintained within a narrow range to sustain life. Thus, solute concentration in a cellular microbe’s external environment exerts a powerful influence on its ability to metabolize and reproduce. Some microorganisms will only grow in the presence of a high solute concentration, but most thrive in an environment with more water and less solute. In this investigation, the student will observe the effect of varying salt concentrations on bacterial growth."
