Through further research, he discovered that <i>Penicillium</i> produced a substance that inhibited growth of the bacteria. Subsequently, penicillin was identified and used as the first antibiotic to treat bacterial infections. Over time, researchers discovered ways to modify the structure of penicillin in the laboratory, and as a result, several forms of penicillin with varying effectiveness exist today. Antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs are now commonly prescribed to treat microbial infections. Such drugs effectively inhibit growth of certain microbes, but different types of microbes may respond differently to the same drug."

When entering the bloodstream, staph bacteria can cause a life-threatening infection. Doctors typically prescribe an antibacterial drug to kill <i>Staphylococcus</i>, and the symptoms of the infection are relieved as the bacteria die. In response to the over-administration of antibacterial drugs, however, resistant staphylococcal bacteria have evolved. As a result, methicillin and similar antibacterial drugs no longer have significant effects against many strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i>"

Medical professionals now advocate prescribing individuals antibacterial drugs only for bacterial infections, not viral infections that will not be affected by them. Patients given antibacterial drugs are instructed to take the prescribed dosage for the full duration of the treatment. A full course of the drug is usually capable of clearing an infection, but a partial treatment (i.e., too low a dosage and/or too short a treatment duration) is more likely to allow resistance to develop.
