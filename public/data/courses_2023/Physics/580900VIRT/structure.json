Two years later astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that other galaxies were moving away from our own, suggesting that not only is the universe still expanding, but also that the universe must have been much closer together at one time in its existence. In its early iterations, the big bang theory hypothesized that all of the matter and energy in the universe began as a single point, or singularity, that then expanded into an extremely hot and dense universe. Calculations made and data collected since then have caused scientists to reject the idea of a singularity, however there is no consensus on an alternative for the state of the universe prior to its expansion.

Stars form in dust clouds in space: when enough matter clumps together the mass is sufficient that the gas and dust begin to contract under its own gravitational pull. As the matter becomes denser, the pressure increases and thus the temperature. This hot mass is known as a protostar and becomes a star as more gas and dust are pulled into it, further increasing its pressure and temperature. Over time, the protostar will reach temperatures in the millions of degrees Celsius, resulting in the fusion of hydrogen nuclei. The intense heat generated by nuclear fusion causes the gases in the mass to expand and a star is born."
