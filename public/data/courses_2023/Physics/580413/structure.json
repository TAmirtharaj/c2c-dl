Earth’s <button class='glossary-text'>magnetic field</button> can sometimes be seen as the aurora in the polar night skies and all compasses point toward the North Pole.  Periodically, throughout Earth’s history, this magnetic field has reversed itself. During these pole reversals, compasses would have pointed toward the South Pole, which would have become the new North Pole of Earth’s magnets. Scientists are still trying to determine why this occurs and whether it can be predicted. However, these reversals have provided scientists with some of the most important evidence for understanding plate tectonics and how the continents have moved over time. As new rock is formed, any magnetic minerals are oriented toward the magnetic North Pole. When they cool, they are stuck in this position. During periods of pole reversal, these iron-containing rocks will be oriented in the opposite direction, which leads to a pattern of lines of alternating polarity. Crucially, these stripes occur in the same pattern on either side of mid-ocean ridges, which helped scientists prove that these were places where new crust was emerging, growing the sea floor and pushing the continents apart. These stripes continue to help scientists study the age and formation of the sea floor."

In a nonmagnetic piece of metal, the domains are organized randomly, as shown in Figure 3. the magnetic fields of the different domains cancel each other out. In a magnet or a piece of metal that has been temporarily magnetized, the domains are aligned as in Figure 4. The effects of the magnetic fields of the individual domains add up, increasing the strength of the overall magnetic field. Iron that is not magnetized can be made into a temporary magnet by repeatedly rubbing it against a permanent magnet. Doing so aligns its magnetic domains, and the iron will subsequently acquire the properties of a magnet. However, the strength of the magnet is often weak, and the effect is temporary."

In the 18th century, scientists such as Benjamin Franklin continued to study electricity. However, it remained a novelty with little practical purpose until the early 19th century. At that time, Hans Christian Ørsted, a Danish physicist, noted that when a current passed through a wire near a magnetic compass, it deflected the compass needle. This observation was the first demonstration of the relationship between electricity and magnetism."

He found that when a magnet moves near a coil of wire, a current is generated in the wire—a phenomenon called <button class='glossary-text'>induction</button>. This phenomenon also works in reverse: when a current passes through a wire, a <button class='glossary-text'>magnetic field</button> is induced in the wire that can interact with the magnetic field of a permanent magnet or <button class='glossary-text'>electromagnet</button>. Induction is the working principle behind electric motors and generators. Based on his findings, Faraday developed the concept of a basic working motor. More practical working motors were later developed, and when power distribution systems became available later in the 19th century, electric motors found commercial success in many applications."

As current flows through the coils of the solenoid, the magnetic field that is generated moves a plunger inside the coils, allowing it to make contact with the starter electrical terminals. An electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy by allowing a coil of wire to turn rapidly when current is passed through it. The magnetic field generated in the coil interacts with that of a permanent magnet or another stationary coil near the spinning coil to produce linear or rotary force. An electric generator functions according to the same principles in the opposite manner; in this application, a mechanical force such as a hand crank or an internal combustion engine turns the spinning coil, inducing an electrical current in the coil. Finally, in a speaker connected to a device, such as a radio, the current in the coil varies according to the signal from the radio. As the coil’s magnetic field fluctuates, the permanent magnet in the speaker pushes and pulls on a coil attached to a diaphragm, a material with a large surface area. The diaphragm vibrates with the movement of the coil, transferring energy to molecules in the air to create sound waves."

                    "Traffic lights operate either on timers or on sensors. In urban areas, there often is enough traffic flow for traffic signal lights to rely on timers. However, in more rural or suburban areas, traffic signals use sensors. These sensors employ technology to determine when vehicles are at an intersection. An inductive loop is embedded under the ground. Inductive loops are coils of wire that detect changes in the <button class='glossary-text'>magnetic field</button> around them. When the coils are placed below the concrete, they produce a specific, measurable inductance. When a vehicle, made primarily of metal, passes over the loop, it acts as a metal core for the loop and changes the current in the coil below the ground. This then sends a signal to the traffic light to cause it to change.",
                    "If you use a wireless charger to charge your cell phone, you are using the inductive power of magnetism. In fact, this wireless transfer technology is called Inductive Power Transfer (IPT). To put it simply, the wireless charger contains coils of wire. When you place a cell phone on top of the charger, electrical current flows between the two electronic devices due to the presence of an electromagnetic field."
