There is a circular border shaded in black, that shows “Interphase” surrounding 3 pieces of the pie chart (~85% of the chart). The 3 pieces are the G1 phase, where rapid growth and metabolic activity occur and centrioles replicate, which is shaded in yellow and taking up about 35% of the chart; the S phase, where growth and DNA synthesis occur, which is shaded in blue and taking up a little over 25% of the chart; the G2 phase, where growth and final preparations for division occur, which is shaded in green and taking up about 20% of the chart. The rest of the circular border (the remaining ~15% across the bottom) is shaded in white and shows the “Mitosis” stage, which surrounds 4 small slices of the chart (~3.5% of the pie chart each), with each stage labeled as follows: telophase, anaphase, metaphase, and prophase.",

In the activity, you will examine a microscope slide on low power, then on high power, before sketching or photographing cells in cell cycle phases. You will then count the number of cells in each phase for three sections of the slide. Next, you will calculate the total number of cells in each phase, as well as the total cells counted, to then calculate the percentage of time the organism spends in each phase. You will repeat this activity for both slides in the slide set. "
