Many communities regularly test wastewater for viral DNA using PCR-based tests, which can help show the viral load in a community before people begin showing symptoms. This can help hospitals prepare for increased illness and public health officials encourage vaccinations. This method can also be used to detect emerging viruses that have not yet been identified as threats. By testing for genes of concern, or viral genes that could make a virus more deadly or more infectious, rather than whole viral sequences, PCR can be a tool in preventing an unknown virus from taking hold."
