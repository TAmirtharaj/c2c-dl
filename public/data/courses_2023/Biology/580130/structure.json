The study of dinosaur fossils specifically has led paleontologists to conclude that they are most closely related to modern-day birds.

The systemic circulation is responsible for providing this oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body and returning it to the heart so it can enter the pulmonary circulation. These two interdependent circulatory loops enable mammals to use oxygen efficiently."

From the ventricles, the blood is forced into the arteries and out of the heart. The muscular walls of the ventricles are much thicker than those of the atria; thus, ventricular contraction creates high pressure to send blood a greater distance.

Finally, the light strikes the photoreceptors, the rods and cones of the retina. Rods are sensitive to low levels of light, but are not sensitive to color. Cones function best in bright light. Because different types of cones are responsive to different wavelengths of light, cones enable color vision.
