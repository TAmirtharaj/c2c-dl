As an exocrine gland, the pancreas secretes pancreatic juice through a duct into the small intestine. This juice contains a number of enzymes essential for the digestion of food and is released into the small intestine through the pancreatic duct. As an endocrine gland, the pancreas secretes into the bloodstream three hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin is essential for normal carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin is secreted into the bloodstream when the level of sugar in the blood rises, which results in an increase in the uptake of blood sugar by cells and a decrease in the level of blood sugar. Glucagon has the opposite effect. Glucagon is secreted when there is a decline in the level of blood sugar. Glucagon causes an immediate but short-lived increase in blood sugar. Insulin and glucagon work together to regulate blood sugar levels. The third hormone is somatostatin, which inhibits the release of glucagon and insulin."

At birth, the ovaries of female mammals contain all the ova the individual will ever ovulate and more. The pig can release as many as 10 to 12 ova during ovulation. All these ova may be fertilized, leading to multiple births. In the mature sow, the ovary resembles a cluster of grapes because of the large number of mature follicles present. The oviduct is a small tube that transports egg cells from the ovary to the uterus. The oviducts extend from each ovary to the horns of the uterus. The muscular uterus of the pig contains two long, tubular uterine horns and a small uterine body. (The uterus of humans has a large body but no horns.)
