Over time, as sediment continues to build upon the buried organism, sedimentary rock forms with the organism's remains encased within the rock.<span className=bodyParaLineBreak>Only some parts of an organism can become fossilized. Because soft parts (internal organs, muscle, skin) decay rapidly, they are rarely fossilized. Organisms made up of only soft parts, such as jellyfish or worms, leave virtually no trace in the fossil record. Hard parts (bones, shells) are more resilient and can be slowly replaced by minerals as they decay. Once fossilized, these structures are made of rock rather than cells.<span className=bodyParaLineBreak>Due to the specific circumstances and body structures required for fossilization, the fossil record represents only a small percentage of the extinct life that once lived on the earth. And the fossils excavated to date represent only a fraction of the total fossil record.
