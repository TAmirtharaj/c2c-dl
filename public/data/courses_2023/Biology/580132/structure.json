Yet, these events do not involve descent through genetic inheritance. The core idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth ultimately shares a common ancestor. Biological evolution consists of change in the hereditary characteristics of groups of organisms over the course of generations, and through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the tremendous biodiversity we see documented in the fossil record around us today."

Examples can be found in the continual evolution of human pathogens that pose serious health concerns. Many strains of microbes have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents that were once effective in controlling these pathogens. Similar episodes of rapid evolution are occurring with important agricultural pests. Numerous insect species have evolved resistance to pesticides, and even to chemical agents genetically engineered into plants to battle them."

This variation is often the result of random <button class='glossary-text'>mutations</button>, or “copying errors,” that arise when DNA is replicated prior to cell division during the development of an organism.

Their development is easy to observe with a microscope or hand lens. A unique adaptation makes them an interesting model for studies of <button class='glossary-text'>natural selection</button>. Under ideal environmental conditions, female brine shrimp produce eggs that hatch quickly into live young; however, when conditions become less conducive, the shrimp instead produce <button class='glossary-text'>cysts</button>—encased embryos that cease development (dormant) until conditions are again favorable (Figure 3). When the temperature or the dissolved oxygen level becomes too low, or the salinity too high, each egg laid is covered in a hardened, brown chorion, which may keep the embryo viable for many years (in a dry, oxygen-free environment). The brine shrimp used in this activity have been stored in this dormant stage. Once the cysts are incubated in saltwater, the embryos quickly resume their development and hatch."

To keep the brine shrimp hatchlings, fill a container with spring water. (A rinsed 2-L drink bottle with the top cut off works well). Dissolve about 2 tablespoons of non-iodized salt per liter of water. Drop in a coarse-bubbling air stone (or similar bubbler) to circulate and oxygenate the water. To prepare a yeast suspension as food for the hatched brine shrimp, make a salt solution as before, and stir in enough baker’s yeast to make the solution milky. Refrigerate the yeast suspension. Agitate it before each use to re-suspend the yeast. Feed the brine shrimp a few drops of the yeast suspension each day. Avoid overfeeding; the water in the culture should not become cloudy. Each week, draw off about one-quarter of the culture water and replace with fresh saltwater. As the shrimp grow, set up additional containers to avoid over-crowding. Newly hatched brine shrimp normally reach adulthood in 8 days."
