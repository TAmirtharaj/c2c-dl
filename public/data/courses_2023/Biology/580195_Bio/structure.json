This sharp beak allows the squid to tear its prey into small pieces while eating it. But this beak also presents a problem for the organisms that prey on squid, like sperm whales. To the sperm whale, the squid’s beak is indigestible and can cause damage to the digestive tract. This leads them to produce a substance called ambergris (pronounced AM-ber-griss or AM-ber-gree). Ambergris forms around the beaks in the whale’s digestive tract and is often found floating in oceans. But how it leaves the body is up for debate: it is either excreted or it remains in the whale and floats away from the body as it decomposes. Once the ambergris leaves the whale, it oxidizes and takes on a musky aroma. This smell and the resulting flavor historically made ambergris an expensive and highly sought-after additive in perfumes and food products, and lead to large-scale hunting of sperm whales to obtain it. The hunting of whales for their ambergris is now banned and most perfume makers use a synthetically derived chemical instead. However, ambergris that is found without harming whales can still be sold in many parts of the world, though not in the United States, for a high price<sup class='bodySupscript'>1</sup>.<span class='bodyParaLineBreak citation' style='line-height: 1.1em;'><sup class='bodySupscript'>1</sup>Rizzo, J.

Because squid lack the hard external shell that characterizes some mollusks, they must have a different means of protection from predators. The squid mantle is covered with <button class='glossary-text'>chromatophores</button>, which are small sacs that contain pigments that reflect light. The chromatophores are connected to small, nervecontrolled muscles that dynamically control the sac size.

This ability allows a squid to rapidly blend into its surrounding environment and thereby avoid detection by predators. The rapidly changing epidermal colors and patterns also are used to signal aggression toward other squid, and to attract female squid during male courtship behaviors. Squid also possess an <button class='glossary-text'>ink sac</button> that can discharge a thick, dark ink into the water through a structure called the siphon.

Many females spawn in the same area, resulting in the production of hundreds of thousands of eggs. After fertilizing the eggs, the female swims away. Many female squid die soon after spawning.

The eyes of squid and other cephalopods are similar to the complex eyes of vertebrates. This is not because cephalopods and vertebrates share a common ancestor, but because of convergent evolution, in which common selective pressures select for similar traits in otherwise very different organisms. Squid and other cephalopods possess a brain-like structure called the cephalic ganglion and a well-developed nervous system, which makes them one of the most intelligent invertebrates.
