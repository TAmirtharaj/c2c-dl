Then, model a cell in interphase, prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. Next, continue modeling the cell in prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. In Activity 3 you will model chromosome mutations by building a nuclear membrane, then modeling meiosis with misregulation in metaphase I. Next, model meiosis with misregulation in metaphase II. Finally, compare each type of nondisjunction.  "
