Plants are sensitive to the wavelength of light throughout their life cycle. <button class='glossary-text'>Phytochromes</button> are photo-responsive pigments that help the plant determine seasons and whether to continue growing or not. The purple light is a combination of red and blue wavelengths, which are absorbed most readily by chlorophyll for photosynthesis. By growing plants indoors under purple lights, food can be grown all year round. This is especially important in areas with short growing seasons or in urban environments where space may be an issue. These indoor farms can also be set up to use less water, fewer nutrients and have better pest control. Using high efficiency LEDs and only the highest-impact wavelengths of light can also reduce the carbon footprint of indoor farming. Additionally, the exact color ratio and intensity of these lights can be manipulated to optimize growth for different species to increase yield and even nutritional content.<sup>1</sup>"

The germination of many types of grasses, fireweed, evening primrose, and lettuce seeds is stimulated by exposure to a short period of light. Conversely, light can inhibit germination in other plants such as garlic and several species of the lily family. One of the best understood examples of the stimulatory effect of light is in lettuce seed germination. Lettuce seeds germinate when exposed to light, whereas keeping the seeds in darkness prolongs dormancy. Only a small intensity of light is necessary to trigger germination. <button class='glossary-text'>Incident light</button> (light directly shining on an object) is a signal that indicates the seed is close enough to the surface for the seedling to emerge and develop photosynthetic machinery before the stored energy and materials are completely consumed."

A longer period of light is needed to indicate that the environmental conditions are now favorable for growth.

This pigment undergoes changes in its conformational structure under the influence of red and far-red light. On reacting with red light, the change in phytochrome structure activates the dormant seed and triggers germination. By contrast, far-red light does not trigger germination and keeps the seeds in a dormant state. This process of activating chlorophyll by sunlight during photosynthesis triggering germination in the phytochrome is called <button class='glossary-text'>photoactivation</button>. Shorter wavelength lights, such as blue light, slow the germination process. Although red light is a crucial factor that triggers germination, other environmental factors such as temperature, water, and humidity also play a role.

Next, you will cover each dish with the colored light filter and place them under the grow light. Each day, you will count the number of germinated seeds in each dish, then reseal the dishes and place them under the grow light. On Day 5, you will count the number of germinated seeds and calculate the germination rate. Then, you will calculate the effect of the wavelength of light on germination. Finally, you will measure the length of the germinated seedlings and calculate seedling vigor. ",
