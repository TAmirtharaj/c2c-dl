Carbon atoms that make up these compounds form strong bonds amongst themselves and thus can create long, stable chains. To organize these compounds, scientists created a naming system or nomenclature. Many organic compounds have common names that do not follow the naming rules. But unlike a name that follows the rules, common names do not reveal the compound’s chemical structure. For example, aspirin is the common name for the compound 2-acetoxybenzoic acid and menthol is the common name for the compound 5-methyl-2-(propan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-ol. "

If the alkane, or other organic compound, is branched, the stem name describes the number of carbons in the longest continuous chain. Numbers are assigned to each carbon atom in this parent chain, as shown in Figure 2. The direction of the numbering must give the lowest numbers to the carbon atoms with substituents. A carbon branch comprised of only single bonds is named as an alkyl group, which is also an alkane that is missing one hydrogen atom. Alkyl groups are always attached to carbon chains as they cannot exist on their own. This group is named by using the suffix <span class=bodyFontItalic>–yl</span> while also using the stem name describing the number of carbons in the group.
