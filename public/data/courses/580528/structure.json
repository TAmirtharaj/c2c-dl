A stimulus is either sufficient to cause a sensory receptor to transmit a nerve impulse to the central nervous system, or it is not. Some sensory receptor cells respond only to a certain stimulus or set of stimuli. For instance, a light receptor cell in the eye may respond only to red light. If a light receptor for red light detects red, it discharges. A receptor cell will only transmit in response to a change in the stimulus to which it is sensitive. Nerve impulses travel through nerve fibers to the brain, where the impulses are processed. By analyzing and interpreting all the inputs from the sense organs, the brain allows us to experience sensory perception. If an injury damages the nerves associated with a sense organ, the brain can no longer obtain accurate information even if the sense organ is healthy and receiving input from stimuli."

The external ear consists of the outer flap that you see, known as the <button class='glossary-text'>pinna</button> (or auricle), which gathers incoming sound waves and funnels them through the <button class='glossary-text'>auditory canal</button> to the <button class='glossary-text'>tympanic membrane</button> (eardrum), which vibrates at the same frequency as the sound waves that contact it. Beyond the tympanic membrane lies the middle ear, an air-filled cavity in the temporal bone of the skull. The middle ear contains a chain of three tiny bones called the <button class='glossary-text'>auditory ossicles</button>: the malleus (hammer), the incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The end of the malleus is embedded in the tympanic membrane, and the stapes is attached to another membrane, the <button class='glossary-text'>oval window</button>, at the entrance to the inner ear. (In Figure 5, the oval window is covered by the flat base of the stapes.) The auditory ossicles transmit sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the sound-sensitive portion of the inner ear. Like the middle ear, the inner ear is situated within the temporal bone. The part of the inner ear concerned with the auditory system is a coiled, bony structure resembling a snail’s shell, known as the <button class='glossary-text'>cochlea</button>."

This phenomenon is called <button class='glossary-text'>bone conduction</button> and will be tested in this investigation. Interestingly, the skull conducts low frequencies better than high frequencies. For this reason, you perceive your own voice to be lower in pitch than others do. It also explains why your voice sounds quite different to you when it is recorded and played back. Bone conduction bypasses some of the hearing mechanism.

Normally, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. In the Rinne test, a low-frequency tuning fork is placed against the mastoid process (the bony bulge just behind the ear) until the subject can no longer hear the sound. Then, the vibrating tuning fork is moved in front of the ear. If the sound is not heard when the fork is moved in front of the ear, bone conduction is greater than air conduction, and something is preventing the transmission of sound to the cochlea."
