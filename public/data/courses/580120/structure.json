In 1918, the first U.S. fad diet book was published by Lulu Hunt Peters, “<span class=bodyFontItalic>Diet & Health: With Key to the Calories</span>”. She suggested that it didn’t matter what a person ate, as long as they only consumed the number of calories that was appropriate for their height. And if the recommended calorie amount was followed, then a person could lose weight. However, it is now understood that eating a balanced diet and maintaining an active lifestyle is an integral part of weight loss.<span className=bodyParaLineBreak>Eating a balanced diet is important and provides the nutrients that your body needs to function effectively. A balanced diet strengthens the immune system and helps protect against communicable and chronic non-communicable diseases. Recently, the USDA introduced the food plate, modified from the food pyramid, to help people remember that everyone needs a balance of fruits, vegetables, grains, <button class='glossary-text'>protein</button>, and smaller amounts of oils and dairy products. Rather than following a strict “diet” they recommend that everyone consume a variety of grains, fruits, and vegetables and limit the amount of saturated fat, sugar, and salt. "

They are produced by photosynthesis in plants and are the preferred substrate for cellular respiration in living organisms. Because sugar molecules are the preferred source of energy, organisms evolved biochemical pathways for linking multiple sugars together to form complex carbohydrates, which store sugar molecules more compactly until they are ready to be used. In organisms that lack internal skeletal systems (such as plants, fungi and insects) complex carbohydrates also serve as structural molecules, providing rigidity to cell walls or exoskeletons, and therefore overall structural support to these groups of organisms.",

The double bonds also cause ‘kinks’ to form in the long chain of carbon atoms that cannot be straightened. Saturated fatty-acid chains have only carbon-carbon single bonds and are more flexible than chains of unsaturated fatty acids.<span className=bodyParaLineBreak>The carbon chains are straight, so the three fatty acids can be packed more tightly. Because of this, triglycerides with saturated fatty acids tend to form solids at much lower temperatures. Saturated fatty acids, such as those in lard, shortening, and butter, are frequently solids at room temperature. The double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids cause the chain to bend and take up more space. Unsaturated fatty acids are usually liquids at room temperature. Triglycerides with saturated fatty acids are usually referred to as fats, whereas unsaturated triglycerides are called oils. Animals usually store lipids as saturated fats, whereas plants tend to store lipids as unsaturated oils. Commonly used oils, such as corn and canola, are triglycerides that contain mostly unsaturated fatty acids."
