For example, <button class='glossary-text'>simple cuboidal epithelium</button> (see Figure 2) consists of a single layer of cube-shaped cells. This type of epithelium is found in the lining of small ducts and tubules, such as those of the kidneys. <button class='glossary-text'>Simple columnar epithelium</button> (see <button class='resource-text'>Figure 3</button>) is a single layer of elongated cells. This type of epithelium is found in the lining of the intestine. <button class='glossary-text'>Stratified squamous epithelium</button> (see <button class='resource-text'>Figure 4</button>) is made up of several layers of cells that are roughly cuboidal at the base of the epithelium but go on to become progressively more flattened as they form the surface of the tissue. This type of epithelium makes up the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Figure 4 depicts the epidermis at the surface of the skin and the dermis (a connective tissue layer) underneath."

There is a segmented layer wrapped around the axon, covering it from a point soon after it emerges from the cell body all the way to where it branches out to form axon terminals.

Next, identify the tissue characteristics and record an image of the tissue under ideal magnification. You will complete this activity for 11 total microscope slides."
